## 2. Results of the Ad Hoc Tasks

### 2.1 Dependence of Purchasing Activity on Character Race
- All races have a similar share of players who made purchases (**60% to 63%**).
- **Human** players make the highest number of transactions per user (**121.4**).
- **Demon** and **Elf** players make the fewest transactions per user (**77.87** and **78.79**, respectively).
- **Northman** players have the highest average total purchase value per user (**62,519.96**).

- **Northman** players also show the highest average transaction value (**761.51**).
- **Human** players have the lowest average transaction value (**403.09**).

Overall, purchasing activity for epic items varies slightly depending on race, indicating no significant differences in gameplay difficulty.

## 3. General Conclusions and Recommendations

- All races demonstrate similar levels of activity and paying player shares, suggesting a common need for epic items across races.
- The very low percentage of zero-value purchases shows active player engagement in the game's economy.
- Differences in the average number of transactions and purchase values per user suggest varying purchasing behavior and strategies among races.
- Further analysis is recommended to understand the reasons for these differences and to optimize game mechanics for a more balanced experience across races.
- Less popular epic items should be reviewed and possibly improved to boost player interest.
