## Project Goal
To analyze the key performance metrics of the food delivery service **"Vse.iz.kafe"** in Saransk for the period from **May 1 to June 30, 2021** by building an interactive dashboard using **Yandex DataLens**.

4. **Retention Rate** — user retention after the first order.
5. **Top 3 Restaurants by LTV** — restaurants with the highest revenue per user.
